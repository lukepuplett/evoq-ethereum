# Evoq.Ethereum

A lightweight .NET library providing Ethereum-specific utilities and extensions. This package builds upon Evoq.Blockchain and Nethereum to provide a simplified interface for Ethereum blockchain operations.

## Installation

```
dotnet add package Evoq.Ethereum
```

## Features

- Ethereum-specific blockchain primitives
- Integration with Nethereum utilities
- Type-safe Ethereum data structures
- Simplified Web3 interactions

## Implementation Notes

### BigInteger Implementations

This library uses two different BigInteger implementations for different encoding schemes:

- **RLP Encoding**: Uses Bouncy Castle's `BigInteger` (`Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger`) which provides better handling of cryptographic values, particularly for variable-length encoding and handling of sign bits.

- **ABI Encoding**: Uses .NET's `System.Numerics.BigInteger` which works well with ABI's fixed-length 32-byte encoding format.

This design decision was made to optimize each encoding method for its specific requirements. In a future release, the library may be split into separate ABI and RLP components to better manage these dependencies.

## Target Frameworks

This package targets .NET Standard 2.1 for maximum compatibility across:
- .NET 6.0+
- .NET Framework 4.6.1+
- .NET Core 2.0+
- Xamarin
- Unity

## Dependencies

- Evoq.Blockchain (1.0.0)
- Nethereum.Util (4.29.0)
- Nethereum.Signer (4.29.0)
- Nethereum.Web3 (4.29.0)

## Usage

```csharp
// Example usage will be added as features are implemented
```

## Building

Testing depends on Golang executables which are included in the repository along with their source code:

1. **gabi** - Used to generate ABI encoding using go-ethereum and serves to test the .NET ABI encoding against the go-ethereum ABI encoding.

2. **grlp** - Used to generate RLP encoding using go-ethereum and serves to test the .NET RLP encoding against the go-ethereum RLP encoding.

Both executables were compiled for macOS on an M chip. They may need to be recompiled for other platforms.

**Note** - The tests do not call these executables directly. Instead, they are used to generate the expected output which is embedded into the test code as the expected output string.

From the folder containing the solution file:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

### Test Rigs

The repository includes Go-based test rigs that generate reference encodings from the go-ethereum implementation:

- **gabi** - For ABI encoding reference outputs
- **grlp** - For RLP encoding reference outputs

For detailed information about the grlp test rig, including usage instructions and test cases, see the [Go RLP Encoder Test Rig README](path/to/grlp/README.md).

## Local Development with Hardhat and EAS

### Setting Up Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

For local testing and development, this project can be integrated with the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.sh/). The following steps outline how to set up a local environment with EAS contracts deployed to a Hardhat node:

1. Clone the EAS repository from GitHub
2. Install the Hardhat Ignition extension (EAS uses Hardhat, not Foundry)
3. Add a custom deployment script
4. Run a local Hardhat node
5. Deploy the EAS contracts to your local node

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- pnpm (EAS uses pnpm as its package manager)
- Git

#### Step 1: Clone the EAS Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts.git
cd eas-contracts
pnpm install
```

#### Step 2: Install Hardhat Ignition

```bash
pnpm add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition
```

Update your `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts` to include the Ignition plugin.

#### Step 3: Create Ignition Deployment Script

Create a directory for your Ignition modules and add a deployment script:

```bash
mkdir -p ignition/modules
```

Create a file at `ignition/modules/eas.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

export default buildModule("EASDeployment", (m) => {
    // Deploy SchemaRegistry first (no constructor args needed)
    const schemaRegistry = m.contract("SchemaRegistry");

    // Deploy EAS with SchemaRegistry address
    const eas = m.contract("EAS", [schemaRegistry]);

    // Return the contract instances
    return {
        schemaRegistry,
        eas,
    };
});
```

#### Step 4: Run a Local Hardhat Node

In a separate terminal window, start a local Hardhat node:

```bash
pnpm hardhat node
```

This will spin up a local Ethereum node with several pre-funded accounts for testing.

#### Step 5: Deploy EAS Contracts

With your local node running, deploy the EAS contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/eas.ts --network localhost
```

After successful deployment, you'll see output similar to:

```
Hardhat Ignition ðŸš€

Deploying [ EASDeployment ]

Batch #1
  Executed EASDeployment#SchemaRegistry

Batch #2
  Executed EASDeployment#EAS

[ EASDeployment ] successfully deployed ðŸš€

Deployed Addresses

EASDeployment#SchemaRegistry - 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
EASDeployment#EAS - 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```

These contract addresses can be used in your application to interact with the EAS system on your local development environment.

### Integration Testing

With the local Hardhat node running and EAS contracts deployed, you can now test your Ethereum applications against a fully functional local blockchain environment. This setup is ideal for:

- Testing smart contract interactions
- Developing and testing dApps
- Validating EAS attestation functionality
- Simulating various blockchain scenarios without spending real ETH
